## üìä Updated Phase 2 Progress

With Task 2.2.7 completed, **Phase 2 is now ~82% complete**:
- ‚úÖ **Database Schema**: 100% complete (7/7 tasks)
- ‚úÖ **User Profile System**: 86% complete (6/7 tasks) - Only Task 2.2.5 (UI Components) remaining
- ‚è≥ **Class & Enrollment Management**: 0% complete (0/5 tasks) - Ready to begin

The comprehensive RBAC system now secures the entire application with role-based access control, permission validation, and resource ownership checks. This critical security foundation enables safe multi-user access and prepares the system for class management and debate functionality in subsequent phases.
