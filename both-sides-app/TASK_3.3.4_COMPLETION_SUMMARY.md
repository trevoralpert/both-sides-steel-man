## üóÇÔ∏è **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE**

### Database Schema Extensions
```sql
-- New enums for milestone and notification management
CREATE TYPE "MilestoneType" AS ENUM (
  'SURVEY_STARTED', 'SECTION_COMPLETED', 'MILESTONE_25_PERCENT', 
  'MILESTONE_50_PERCENT', 'MILESTONE_75_PERCENT', 'SURVEY_COMPLETED', 
  'PROFILE_GENERATED', 'PROFILE_CONFIRMED'
);

CREATE TYPE "NotificationType" AS ENUM (
  'COMPLETION_CELEBRATION', 'PROGRESS_REMINDER', 'TEACHER_NOTIFICATION', 
  'FOLLOW_UP_SURVEY', 'RE_ENGAGEMENT'
);

CREATE TYPE "NotificationStatus" AS ENUM (
  'PENDING', 'SENT', 'DELIVERED', 'FAILED', 'EXPIRED'
);

-- Three new tables with complete relationships and indexes
CREATE TABLE "survey_milestones" (/* ... */);
CREATE TABLE "class_completion_stats" (/* ... */);
CREATE TABLE "completion_notifications" (/* ... */);
```

### Service Architecture
- **CompletionTrackingService**: Core business logic for milestones, analytics, notifications
- **CompletionSchedulerService**: Automated scheduling with 6 different cron jobs
- **CompletionTrackingController**: 12 REST endpoints with full RBAC integration

### API Endpoints (12 total)
**Milestone Management**:
- `POST /surveys/completion/milestones` - Record milestone achievement
- `GET /surveys/completion/milestones/me` - Get user's milestones
- `GET /surveys/completion/milestones/student/:id` - Get student milestones (teachers)

**Analytics Dashboard**:
- `GET /surveys/completion/analytics/class/:id` - Class completion analytics
- `POST /surveys/completion/analytics/bulk` - Bulk class analytics
- `GET /surveys/completion/analytics/teacher/me` - Teacher dashboard

**Notification System**:
- `POST /surveys/completion/notifications` - Create notification
- `GET /surveys/completion/notifications/me` - User notifications
- `GET /surveys/completion/notifications/teacher` - Teacher notifications
- `POST /surveys/completion/notifications/process` - Process pending (admin)

## üîí **SECURITY & PERMISSIONS**

### RBAC Integration
- **Students**: Can record milestones and view their own progress
- **Teachers**: Full analytics access for their classes, notification management
- **Admins**: System-wide access, notification processing controls

### Data Privacy
