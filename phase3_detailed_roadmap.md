## Phase 3 Completion Checklist

### **Technical Requirements**:
- [ ] Survey system handles all question types efficiently
- [ ] AI belief analysis produces accurate and educational profiles
- [ ] Embedding generation and similarity search perform at scale
- [ ] Onboarding experience is engaging and completion rates are high

### **Quality Assurance**:
- [ ] Survey data validation ensures high-quality responses
- [ ] AI-generated content is appropriate and accurate
- [ ] Belief profiles are consistent and meaningful
- [ ] System performance scales to classroom-sized user groups

### **Security & Privacy**:
- [ ] Political belief data is properly encrypted and protected
- [ ] User consent and privacy controls are comprehensive
- [ ] FERPA compliance is maintained for educational use
- [ ] Data retention and deletion policies are implemented

### **Ready for Phase 4 (Matching Engine)**:
- [ ] Belief profiles are complete and accurate
- [ ] Embedding similarity calculations are reliable
- [ ] Opinion plasticity scoring enables intelligent matching
- [ ] Profile quality is sufficient for productive debate pairing

---

## Dependencies for Phase 4:
- **Belief profiles must be accurate** before matching can work effectively
- **Embedding system must be optimized** before large-scale similarity calculations
- **Survey completion rates must be high** before classroom-wide matching
- **Profile quality validation must be robust** before automated debate assignment

---

**ðŸŽ“ Educational Impact Note**: Phase 3 is where the Both Sides application becomes truly educational - transforming political awareness into structured learning opportunities through sophisticated belief mapping and analysis.

---

*This roadmap ensures Phase 3 builds on the solid Phase 2 foundation while creating the sophisticated belief mapping system that differentiates Both Sides from simple debate platforms.*
