## Timeline Summary

**Total Duration**: 3-4 weeks with optimal resource allocation (3.5 weeks with parallel execution)

### Standard Sequential Timeline:
- **Week 1**: Steps 7.1-7.2 (Foundation + AI Analysis)
- **Week 2**: Steps 7.3-7.4 (Reflection Collection + Analytics)
- **Week 3**: Step 7.5 (UI Development)
- **Week 4**: Testing, Integration, and Polish

### Optimized Parallel Timeline:
- **Week 1**: 7.1 foundation, 7.1.3+7.1.4 in parallel, start 7.2.1
- **Week 2**: 7.2.2+7.2.3 in parallel, 7.2.5 (engagement) in parallel with 7.3 start
- **Week 2.5**: Complete 7.3 (reflection), start 7.4 analytics
- **Week 3**: Complete 7.4, start 7.5.4 visualization components
- **Week 3.5**: 7.5.1+7.5.2 dashboards in parallel, then 7.5.3 integration

### Key Parallelization Opportunities:
- **7.1.3 + 7.1.4**: Data models and job queues can develop concurrently
- **7.2.2 + 7.2.3**: Summaries and argument analysis both use transcript analysis
- **7.2.5**: Engagement metrics can run parallel with reflection collection (7.3)
- **7.5.1 + 7.5.2**: Student and teacher dashboards use same visualization components

This roadmap ensures a logical progression from data infrastructure through AI analysis to user-facing features, with parallel execution reducing timeline by ~0.5 weeks while minimizing dependencies and preventing rework.
