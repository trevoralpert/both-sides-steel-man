## Dependencies & Critical Path Notes

### Key Dependencies:
1. **Authentication must be completed** before any user-specific features
2. **Database schema must be stable** before building APIs
3. **Profile system must work** before matching can be implemented
4. **Real-time infrastructure must be solid** before debate features
5. **Core debate system must be functional** before reflection features
6. **MockRosterProvider must be complete** before TimeBack abstraction

### Parallel Development Opportunities:
- UI components can be built alongside API development
- Testing can be written in parallel with feature development
- Documentation can be created as features are completed
- Integration layer can be built while core features are stabilized

### Risk Mitigation:
- Each phase has clear deliverables and success criteria
- Dependencies are explicitly mapped to prevent blocking
- Integration points are abstracted to allow independent development
- Testing is integrated throughout rather than left to the end

This roadmap ensures a logical flow from foundation to launch while maintaining flexibility for iteration and improvement.
