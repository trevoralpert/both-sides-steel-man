# Phase 2: Core Data Models & API Foundation - Detailed Roadmap

## Overview
This phase builds the essential data structures and API endpoints that will serve as the foundation for the entire Both Sides application. The order of tasks has been carefully designed to prevent dependency conflicts and minimize rework.

**Duration Estimate**: 2.5-3 weeks (with parallel execution) | 3-4 weeks (sequential)  
**Team Size**: 2-3 developers  
**Prerequisites**: Phase 1 must be complete (authentication, database connection, basic project structure)

**🚀 Optimization Note**: This phase includes multiple parallel execution opportunities that can reduce timeline by 20-25% when properly coordinated.

## 🚀 Parallel Development Strategy

### Maximum Efficiency Execution Plan

**Week 1: Database Foundation**
- **Day 1-3**: Complete Task 2.1.1 (Users table) - *BLOCKING*
- **Day 3-5**: **PARALLEL EXECUTION**
  - Developer A: Task 2.1.2 (Organizations/Classes)
  - Developer B: Task 2.1.3 (Enrollments) + Task 2.1.4 (Profiles)

**Week 2: Schema & Core APIs**
- **Day 1**: Task 2.1.5 (Run migrations) - *BLOCKING*
- **Day 2-3**: **PARALLEL EXECUTION**
  - Developer A: Task 2.1.7 (Row-Level Security)
  - Developer B: Task 2.1.6 (TimeBack columns)
- **Day 4-5**: Task 2.2.1 (Profile APIs) - *BLOCKING*

**Week 2-3: Profile System**

## Dependencies for Phase 3:
- User profiles must be complete before belief mapping
- Class enrollment must work before student matching
- RosterProvider interface must be stable before external integrations
- Row-level security must be configured before sensitive data handling

## 🔧 Parallel Development Opportunities Summary:

### ✅ **Safe to Parallelize** (No Dependency Conflicts):
1. **Tasks 2.1.2, 2.1.3, 2.1.4** - All only depend on 2.1.1 Users table
2. **Tasks 2.1.6, 2.1.7** - Both only depend on 2.1.5 Migration completion
3. **Tasks 2.2.2, 2.2.3, 2.2.4** - All only depend on 2.2.1 Core APIs
4. **Task 2.2.5** - Can start with basic APIs, doesn't need all backend features

### ⚠️ **Sequential Required** (Hard Dependencies):
- **2.1.1** → Must complete before any other database work
- **2.1.5** → Must complete before RLS/TimeBack work
- **2.2.1** → Must complete before other profile work
- **2.2.6** → Must complete before RBAC (2.2.7)
- **Step 2.3** → Must be sequential due to tight interdependencies

### 📈 **Optimization Impact**:
- **Time Savings**: 20-25% reduction (4 weeks → 2.5-3 weeks)
- **Resource Efficiency**: Better developer utilization
- **Risk Mitigation**: Parallel work doesn't increase dependency risk

This detailed roadmap ensures Phase 2 builds a solid foundation for the Both Sides application while maintaining proper dependency flow, minimizing rework, and maximizing development efficiency through strategic parallelization.
